# Two Hidden Layer Neural Network 

This is a **Numpy** only implementation of a 2 hidden layer neural network with complete vectorized code. The loss function used is the **Cross Entropy Loss** and the activation function used is **Rectified Linear Units (ReLu)**.

There are 2 files namely :

1. ``` neuralNetwork.py ``` which contains the neural network class with the **forward** and **backward** pass functions.

2. ``` neuralNetDemo.py ``` wherein a toy data set is used for training the neural network.
